# The ArkIDE Project
## ArkIDE is a fork of Penguinmod made by 2 people in spite of our school blocking Penguinmod.

What this adds from penguinmod:
- New extensions
- Revamped UI (WIP)
- Nice purple/blue theme
- Full on project servers (that are a bit more stable than penguinmods lol)
- And a bunch more
