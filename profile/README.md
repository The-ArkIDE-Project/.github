# The ArkIDE Project
## ArkIDE is a fork of Penguinmod made by 2 people in spite of our school blocking Penguinmod.

What this adds from penguinmod:
- New extensions (Like ArKIDE Additions, JSON Numbers arrays, and ArkIDE Console)
- Revamped UI (WIP)
- Nice purple/blue theme
- Full on project servers (that are a bit more stable than penguinmods lol)
- Full on extension creator (forked from another repo where I updated the app a bunch)
- And a bunch more

# Why the name  "ArkIDE"
Well, my online name is "Ark" as you can tell, and IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment", and penguinmod is an IDE, so I combined the 2 and got "ArkIDE", Heavaly inspired by the other penguinmod fork, "SnailIDE"

# ArkIDE Todo:
- Sync the ArkIDE Editor repo with penguinmods (to get all the new features)
- Code and add new extensions for ArkIDE (Already have 3 new ones so far)
